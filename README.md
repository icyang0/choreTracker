#todo

1. handle future dates
2. add better handling of chore inputs????
3. renove "-ed" (plus any extra doubled consotants... eg bagged) from the input chore

4. add recall #x tasks added
5. delete all tasks




#USAGE
Tell Chore Tracker when you did a task or chore. Then the next time you want to remember how long ago it was, Chore Tracker will remind you how long ago it was, all in one simple voice interface!

For example, to input the date you did a chore:
"Alexa, tell Chore Tracker I took my vitamins today."
or
"Alexa, tell Chore Tracker that yesterday I vaccuumed the floor."

And the next time you get the feeling that the fridge is starting to smell, or the dog is looking a bit shaggy, just say:

"Alexa, ask Chore Tracker when was the last time I cleaned out the fridge?"
or
"Alexa, when did I last groom the dog?"

And Chore Tracker will pull it up :)
"The last time you cleaned the fridge was about 1 year, 5 months ago, on Wednesday 6/10/2015."


#DONE:

IF THERES NO CHORE AND YOU CALL IT BACK, PROGRAM BTREAKS
CALLING DELETE CHORE ALSO BREAKS PROGRAM

1. format date input to DB
2. format date output to user3. fix DB storage method?? (seperate items?)

7. remove extraneous code
