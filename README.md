#todo




1. IMPLEMENT ALL REPROMPTS CORRECTLY
2. handle dates without a year??? outputs something but its incorrect
2. handle non-correct dates, like may 35th or something
1. handle weird date requests, like last weekend, or this week, or this month or next year, or this decade, or next winter.

4. try and better do the time elasped appx

4. add recall #x tasks added
5. delete all tasks

6. most tasks now are past tense.... still some bugs




#USAGE
Tell Chore Tracker when you did a task or chore. Then the next time you want to remember how long ago it was, Chore Tracker will remind you how long ago it was, all in one simple voice interface!

For example, to input the date you did a chore:
"Alexa, tell Chore Tracker I took my vitamins today."
or
"Alexa, tell Chore Tracker that yesterday I vaccuumed the floor."

And the next time you get the feeling that the fridge is starting to smell, or the dog is looking a bit shaggy, just say:

"Alexa, ask Chore Tracker when was the last time I cleaned out the fridge?"
or
"Alexa, when did I last groom the dog?"

And Chore Tracker will pull it up :)
"The last time you cleaned the fridge was about 1 year, 5 months ago, on Wednesday 6/10/2015."
